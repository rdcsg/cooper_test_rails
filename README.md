This is an application where we gauge an athlete's performance on the physical fitness test called the Cooper Test where the fitness levels depends on depending on gender, age and performance (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_test).

We use Ruby on Rails for the backend functionality and use JavaScript to create the logic on the client side. The application is a mobile only application for iOS and Android and we use AngularJS and Ionic to connect the backend to the client side logic.

The content in this repo manages the backend in Rails and tested with Rspec.
Connected repos to this repo are cooper_test_js and cooper_test_ionic.
